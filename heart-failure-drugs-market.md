<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Failure Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ACEI</li><li>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers</li><li>ARNIs</li><li>Beta Blockers</li><li>Aldosterone Antagonists</li><li>Diuretics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart failure drugs market encompasses several key therapeutic categories. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce heart workload. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) serve a similar purpose with fewer side effects. ARNIs combine an ARB with a neprilysin inhibitor, enhancing treatment efficacy. Beta blockers improve heart function and rhythm, while aldosterone antagonists reduce fluid retention. Diuretics aid in managing symptoms by promoting fluid excretion. Together, these drug types form a comprehensive approach to heart failure management.</p></p>
