<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retractable Safety Syringes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Retractable Safety Syringe</li><li>Auto-retarctable Safety Syringe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retractable safety syringes market comprises two primary types: manual retractable safety syringes and auto-retractable safety syringes. Manual retractable syringes require the user to activate the retraction mechanism after use, enhancing safety by preventing needle-stick injuries. In contrast, auto-retractable syringes automatically withdraw the needle into the barrel after injection, minimizing the risk of accidental exposure. Both types are designed to improve safety in medical settings, reduce contamination risks, and ensure proper disposal of used needles.</p></p>
